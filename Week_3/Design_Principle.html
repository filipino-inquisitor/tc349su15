    <p>There are a lot of options for the user to select once they enter Amazon's homepage.

    <h2>Ockham's Razor (Decision):</h2>
    <p>Given the choice between functionally equivalent designs,	
    the simplest design should be selected.</p>
    <img src="https://christiannarvios.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/okhams_razor_ello1.png" alt="Ello homepage"/>
    <p>Similiar to the S/N Ratio, it displays a clean aspect with not many irrelevant information
		on the page. It shows images and those images can be selected. This gives the website both a 
		functionality and designability that truly meets clean expectations.</p>
